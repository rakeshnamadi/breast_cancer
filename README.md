# breast_cancer
Breast cancer is became a chronical disease now-a-days. Predicting the breast cancer cells is a quite difficult task in crucial time. A machine learning model that used to predict cancer cells.


Accuracy Score of Support vector classifier:
0.9941520467836257

Model is upgraded with another algorithm of machine learning in the view of accuracy score. As our dataset is labelled data it falls under supervised learning, support vector machines are one of the best algorithms in supervised learning. It is a classification model. Here, diagnosis is depended variable.
